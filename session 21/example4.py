# MVC - Java - Model View Control
# Model - database table
# View - displayed on the screen to the user - UI example
#           - req => reponse
# Control - accepting the request
#           business logic that we need to implement in order 
#           to produce desired outputs

# Python  - MVT - Model View Template
# Model - defines database table 
# View - accepts request - sends the model to the template 
        # - returns the response
# Template - look and feel of the UI that needs to be displayed to the user
