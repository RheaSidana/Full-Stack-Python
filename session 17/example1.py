dynamically typed - we can hop from one datatype to another
strict typed - we cannot hop from one data type to another


OOPs - Object Oriented Programming 
-> Classes - blue-print real world entity - defined a functionality using code 
            - user defined data type - has a collection of primitive data types
            - data member and member functions
            e.g - TV, car, keyboard, mouse
            - Property (data member)
                - model number
                - unique id
                - model Name
                - company manufacturer
                - screen (dimension, resolution, type)
            - function  
                - switch on 
                - switch off
                - change the channel 
                    - up and down keys of the remote
                    - enter the channel number
                - change the volume
                - play game 
                 ......
-> Objects are the actual implementation of the class
-> Encapsulation - collection data members and member functions in one unit 
                of a particular type 
                - class depicts the real meaning encapsulation 
                - data hiding - denying the access to change properties of 
                the class/ object
                - abstraction - the steps taken in order to perform a particular function
                that are not needed by the user to know are kept hidden from the User
-> Inheritance - Parent - Child relationship
                - Parent is having the general properties and functions
                - Child is having specification of the parent class' properties and functions 
                plus its own features
                - e.g, Shape 
                    -property
                        - vertices, edges 
                    - functionality
                        - area and perimeter
                    Child class - Rectangle, Circle, Square
                    Child class - Cone, cylinder (3d)- combination of - volume
-> Polymorphism - Poly - different/ many 
                -morphism - form
                - function addition(param1, param2){-----}
                - function addition(param1, param2, param3, param4) {----}
                - addition(1,3) 
                - addition(1,3,5,7)
