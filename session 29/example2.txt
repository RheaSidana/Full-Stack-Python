Admin Interface
- allows developers to manage their application data with minimal effort
- user-friendly
- web-based interface to perform CRUD operations
- customisable and extensible => suitable for various admin tasks

advantageS:
- automatic Interface Generation for managing models
- user management - authentication, authorisation 
- customization - to suit specific needs
- search and filter - quickly find and manage data


Ordering Fields: 
field=[]
this list enables us to access the fields in the Admin site,
rest of the fields are not accessible 
when rows are accessed separately
- can be used for grouping as well

exclude=[]
this list enables us to not access the fields in the Admin site,
rest of the fields are accessible 
when rows are accessed separately

fieldset - grouping fields together with the headings defined

search_field=[]
helps in searching all the rows that are correspondig to the partcular value.

filters - applied when we know that a particular column can have 
a certain set of values only

editable List View
- makes certain field of the rows, editable directly from the list views
- saves time
- no need to access the rows separately to edit then save them
